          </h2>
          <p>Security is about protecting data.</p>
          <p>The CIA Triad</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Confidentiality</li>
            <li>Integrity</li>
            <li>Availability</li>
          </ol>
          <p>Confidentiality: Only authorized parties can access data. (ACLs and encryption)</p>
          <p>Integrity: Data has not been improperly modified. Includes knowing if data has been modified.</p>
          <p>Availability: Authorized parties have access to data when they need it. Includes protecting systems that store, process, and deliver data.</p>
          <p>Defense in depth: Protecting the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data by securing everything that touches the data, including storage, compute and networking</p>
          <p>Levels of Architecture: AWS services, Operating systems, Applications</p>
          <h4>AWS Credentials</h4>
          <p>Root User: Full access to all AWS resources. Only one root user per account.</p>
          <p>IAM principal: Any entity(could be a user or an application) that can perform actions on AWS services and resources. Policies determine what permissions a principal has</p>
          <p>Locking down the Root user: Enable MFA. Don't use the root user for administrative tasks. Use a non-root IAM user with administrative permissions</p>
          <p>IAM Principal: The foundation of IAM. An entity that can take an action on an AWS service. Often used as a synonym for identity. Principles include users and roles</p>
          <p>A non-root principal has no permissions by default. Policies determine what permission a principal has</p>
          <p>You must grant permissions to a principal by associating it with a policy.</p>
          <p>Policy and Permission: A policy consists of multiple permission statements. A permission statement consists of 4 elements.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Effect (allow or deny)</li>
            <li>Service (etc: EC2)</li>
            <li>Action/Operation (RunInstances)</li>
            <li>Resource (image/ami-fjdfjfsdk)</li>
            <li>Request condition(MFA, IP range, time...) (198.51.100.0/24)</li>
          </ol>
          <p>This permission will allow a principal to run an EC2 instance with certain AMI, when it is in certain IP range.</p>
          <p>AWS managed policies: AWS has many managed policies created for us to use. (they are updated regularly to include new services)</p>
          <p>The deny effect always takes precedence over the allow effect (deny > allow)</p>
          <img src="1.png">
          <p>We can create inline policy for a user to deny he's access to terminate any EC2 instances.</p>
          <img src="2.png">
          <p>This is the JSON representation of the policy</p>
          <img src="3.png">
          <p>We could use policy simulator to check the effectiveness of the policy.</p>
          <p>We could also create inline policy for a group.</p>
          <h4>Summary</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Implement MFA for the root user</li>
            <li>User an administrative user instead of root user</li>
            <li>AWS managed policies are updated as new services and actions are added</li>
            <li>A policy permission consists of an effect, service, action/operation and resource</li>
            <li>A user policy is an inline policy embedded in a user</li>
            <li>A group policy is embedded in a group</li>
            <li>Customer Managed policies work like AWS managed policies, but are created and managed by you</li>
          </ol>

            <a href="#title" class="headerlink" title="Part 1">Part Two: Capturing and Analyzing Logs</a>
          </h2>
          <h4>Module Overview</h4>
          <ol>
            <li>Capturing events with CloudTrail</li>
            <li>Viewing Logs with CloudWatch Logs</li>
            <li>Creating alerts with CloudWatch Alarms</li>
            <li>Searching logs with Athena</li>
            <li>Tracking changes with AWS config</li>
          </ol>
          <p>CloudTrail logs are stored in S3. Limit what you log to control costs</p>
          <p>CloudTrail event types</p>
          <p>Management: Configuration changes to AWS services. Reading resources. Logging into the management console. Assuming a role.</p>
          <p>Data: Access to S3 objects. Lambda function execution</p>
          <p>CloudTrail: Logs AWS actions. Stores logs in S3</p>
          <p>CloudWatch Logs: Aggregates logs from CloudTrail and non-AWS sources. Provides interface to view and search logs</p>
          <h4>Create IAM service role</h4>
          <p>Contains inline service policy that grants CloudTrail permissions to send logs to CloudWatch Logs</p>
          <p>Contains trust policy that allows CloudTrail to assume the role</p>
          <p>Role is an IAM principal for CloudTrail to use to authenticate to CloudWatch Logs</p>
          <h4>Demo</h4>
          <img src="4.PNG">
          <img src="5.PNG">
          <p>Create a log group in CloudWatch Logs</p>
          <p>Create an IAM role for CloudTrail to assume. The Role will have two permission statements. It can create log streams and it can put the log into CloudWatch Log groups.</p>
          <img src="6.PNG">
          <img src="7.PNG">
          <p>The CloudTrail and the Role have a trusted relationship. If we have a look at the JSON policy. It will allow CloudTrail to assume the Role. The Role will give its permissions to CloudTrail.</p>
          <img src="8.png">
          <img src="9.png">
          <p>Create CloudWatch Alarm we need to select a metric, in this case, IncomingLogEvents. We define the alarm so that it triggers the alarm if CloudTrail send more than 1 log to CloudWatch Logs within 1 minute period of time.</p>
          <img src="10.png">
          <p>We also created new topic with an email address so I will get notified if this happens.</p>
          <img src="11.png">
          <p>After the alarm has been created, the status is OK because we didn't receive any logs in the last 1 minutes. And we treat missing logs as Good.</p>
          <img src="12.png">
          <p>When there is logs coming in, the status will be changed to In alarm for that 1 minute period and will be changed back to OK the next minute.</p>
          <p>Notice the alarm logs are not in real time. There maybe a couple of minutes delay.</p>
