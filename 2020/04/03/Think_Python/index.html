          <h3>Python interpreter</h3>
          <p>Type python in the command line to start interpreter</p>
          <code>Python 3.4.0 (default, Jun 19 2015, 14:20:21)
          [GCC 4.8.2] on linux
          Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
          >>>
          </code>
          <p>The first three lines contain information about the interpreter and the operating system it’s
          running on, so it might be different for you. But you should check that the version number,
          which is 3.4.0 in this example, begins with 3, which indicates that you are running Python
          3. If it begins with 2, you are running (you guessed it) Python 2.
          The last line is a prompt that indicates that the interpreter is ready for you to enter code. If
          you type a line of code and hit Enter, the interpreter displays the result:</p>
          <code>
          >>> 1 + 1
          2
          </code>
          <h3>Basic Arthmetic</h3>
          <code>>>> 40 + 2
          42
          >>> 43 - 1
          42
          >>> 6 * 7
          42
          </code>
          <p>
          The operator / performs division:
          </p>
          <code>
          >>> 84 / 2
          42.0
          </code>
          <p>
          You might wonder why the result is 42.0 instead of 42. I’ll explain in the next section.
          Finally, the operator ** performs exponentiation; that is, it raises a number to a power:
          </p>
          <code>
          >>> 6**2 + 6
          42
          </code>
          <p>
          In some other languages, ^ is used for exponentiation, but in Python it is a bitwise operator
          called XOR. If you are not familiar with bitwise operators, the result will surprise you:
          </p>
          <code>
          >>> 6 ^ 2
          4
          </code>
          <h3>Values and Types</h3>
          <p>If you are not sure what type a value has, the interpreter can tell you:</p>
          <code>
          >>> type(2)
          < class 'int'>
          >>> type(42.0)
          < class 'float'>
          >>> type('Hello, World!')
          < class 'str'>
          </code>
          <h2 id="u6587_u7AE0_u7ED3_u6784">
            <a href="#u6587_u7AE0_u7ED3_u6784" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 2: Variables Expressions and Statements"></a>Chapter 2: Variables Expressions and Statements
          </h2>
          <h3>Statement</h3>
          <p>An assignment statement creates a new variable and gives it a value:</p>
          <code>
            >>> message = 'And now for something completely different'
            >>> n = 17
            >>> pi = 3.1415926535897932
          </code>
          <h3>Expressions</h3>
          <p>An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators. A value all by itself is considered an expression, and so is a variable, so the following are all legal expressions:</p>
          <code>
            >>> 42
            42
            >>> n
            17
            >>> n + 25
            42
          </code>
          <p>When you type an expression at the prompt, the interpreter evaluates it, which means that
          it finds the value of the expression. In this example, n has the value 17 and n + 25 has the
          value 42.
          A statement is a unit of code that has an effect, like creating a variable or displaying a
          value.</p>
          <h3>Order of operations</h3>
          <p>Parentheses have the highest precedence and can be used to force an expression to
          evaluate in the order you want. Since expressions in parentheses are evaluated first,
          2 * (3-1) is 4, and (1+1)**(5-2) is 8. You can also use parentheses to make an
          expression easier to read, as in (minute * 100) / 60, even if it doesn’t change the
          result.</p>
          <p>Exponentiation has the next highest precedence, so 1 + 2**3 is 9, not 27, and 2 *
          3**2 is 18, not 36.</p>
          <p>Multiplication and Division have higher precedence than Addition and Subtraction.
          So 2*3-1 is 5, not 4, and 6+4/2 is 8, not 5.
          </p>
          <p>Operators with the same precedence are evaluated from left to right (except exponentiation). So in the expression degrees / 2 * pi, the division happens first and the
          result is multiplied by pi. To divide by 2π, you can use parentheses or write degrees
          / 2 / pi.</p>
          <h3>Comments</h3>
          <p>comments, and they start with
          the # symbol. """fdsfsdfsd""" for multiple lines of comments
          </p>

            <a href="#u6587_u7AE0_u7ED3_u6784" class="headerlink" title="Chapter 3: Functions"></a>Chapter 3: Functions
          </h2>
          <p>In the context of programming, a function is a named sequence of statements that performs
          a computation. When you define a function, you specify the name and the sequence of
          statements. Later, you can “call” the function by name.</p>
          <p>It is common to say that a function “takes” an argument and “returns” a result. The result
          is also called the return value.
          </p>
          <p>Python has a math module that provides most of the familiar mathematical functions. A
          module is a file that contains a collection of related functions.
          Before we can use the functions in a module, we have to import it with an import statement:
          </p>
          <code>>>> import math</code>
          <h3>Adding new functions</h3>
          <p>So far, we have only been using the functions that come with Python, but it is also possible
          to add new functions. A function definition specifies the name of a new function and the
          sequence of statements that run when the function is called.</p>
          <code>def print_lyrics():
          print("I'm a lumberjack, and I'm okay.")
          print("I sleep all night and I work all day.")</code>
          <p>The first line of the function definition is called the header; the rest is called the body. The
          header has to end with a colon and the body has to be indented. By convention, indentation
          is always four spaces. The body can contain any number of statements.</p>
          <p>A function can be inside another function</p>
          <h3>Parameters and arguments</h3>
          <p>Some of the functions we have seen require arguments. For example, when you call
          math.sin you pass a number as an argument. Some functions take more than one argument: math.pow takes two, the base and the exponent.
          </p>
          <p>When you create a variable inside a function, it is local, which means that it only exists
          inside the function</p>
          <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
          <p>Wrapping a piece of code up in a function is called encapsulation. One of the benefits of
          encapsulation is that it attaches a name to the code, which serves as a kind of documentation. Another advantage is that if you re-use the code, it is more concise to call a function
          twice than to copy and paste the body!</p>
