## What is a Web Server?

* a web server is the software that receives your request to access a web page. It runs a few security checks on your HTTP request and takes you to the web page. Depending on the page you have requested, the page may ask the server to run a few extra modules while generating the document to serve you. It then serves you the document you requested.

* Apache is the most widely used web server software. Developed and maintained by Apache Software Foundation, Apache is an open source software available for free. It runs on 67% of all webservers in the world. It is fast, reliable, and secure. It can be highly customized to meet the needs of many different environments by using extensions and modules. Most WordPress hosting providers use Apache as their web server software.

* A web server like Apache, is also the Maitre Dâ€™ of the restaurant. It handles your communications with the website (the kitchen), handles your requests, makes sure that other staff (modules) are ready to serve you. It is also the bus boy, as it cleans the tables (memory, cache, modules) and clears them for new customers.

## What is the differences between .NET Framework and .NET Core?

* In 2002, Microsoft released .NET Framework 1.0 as a proprietary software framework for Windows platform. It has been updating the .NET Framework regularly to meet the emerging trends in software development. But Microsoft recently redesigned the core architecture of the .NET Framework to simplify development, testing, and deployment of modern software applications. The company released .NET Core 1.0 in June, along with ASP.NET Core 1.0 and Entity Framework.

* Unlike .NET Framework, .NET Core is both open source and cross-platform. It further comes with several new features to simplify development and testing of desktop, web, cloud, and mobile applications. Also, it allows developers to deploy the applications in a number of ways. But .NET Core does not support all features and functionalities of .NET Framework. Hence, it becomes essential for developers to understand the major differences between .NET Framework and .NET Core before switching to the most recent version of the popular software framework.
